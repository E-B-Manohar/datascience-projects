# Exercise 1: Tree Map

## Journalism Scenario

You are a reporter for a metro daily news organization and you cover local politics.
You have just downloaded data showing how much each local governmental agency in the state has paid for lobbyists to go to the state capitol and work for their causes.
You think there’s a story here, but you’re not sure what it is.

There is a few key findings in this report:

1. Cities government spent the most in terms of lobbying spending including compensation and expenses, accounting for 34.51% of total lobbying spending in all government entities. Three cities with the highest spending in lobbying are City of Seattle, followed by City of Tacoma and City of Everett. Only City of Seattle and City of Tacoma spent more than $60k in their lobbying spending.  
2. Public facilities districts spent the least in lobbying, only accounting for 0.95% of all spending.  
3. It is interesting to see that Other type of government spent the most in total expenses and mostly contributed by Washington Indian Gaming Association.  

More data and information are required to know why City of Tacoma, City of Everettand Washington Indian Gaming Association spent a substantial amount of money in expenses and compensation.  

The information in the report includes three calculations including Total Lobbying, Average Lobbying and Percentage.  

* Total Lobbying: [Compensation] + [Expenses]  

* Average Lobbying: AVG([Total Lobbying])  

* Percentage: SUM([Total Lobbying]) / TOTAL(SUM([Total Lobbying]))

# Exercise 2: Map

<iframe align = "center" width = "1000" height = "800" src = "https://public.tableau.com/views/Exercise2-Map/Washington?:showVizHome=no&:embed=true"></iframe>  

<br>

There is a few key findings from the lobbying and census data.  

The city in Washington with the highest total lobbying per capita is Port Orchard, spending 1.077 per capita with population of 11144, followed by Arlington at 0.764 per capita with population of 17926 and Kenmore at 0.684 with population of 20460.  

Seattle, the city with the highest population in Washington at 608660, is only spending 0.227 per capita. The city with the lowest lobbying spending is Auburn, spending 0.027. It has a population of 70180.  

It is interesting to see a town with a small population spent a substantial amount of money per capita compared to cities with bigger population. Lobbying is the act of influencing a legislator on an issue and it is an important part of the democratic process. Big businesses are also interested in lobbying local governments to meet their capitalistic interests.  

To report the story, it has to be written based on the audience that it is intended to reach. The source of information has to be verified and readers are informed about how and when the information are obtained.  
It is important that the story is reread before it is being published to ensure accuracy and fairness. The story has to be told in the right context and important points are conveyed to the readers. 

# Exercise 3: Refinery Accidents

<iframe align = "center" width = "1000" height = "800" src = "https://public.tableau.com/views/AccidentsState/Dashboard1?:showVizHome=no&:embed=true"></iframe>  

<br>

Using the Refinery Accidents of the US Dashboard, RMP facilities can be identified in all states in the US.  

The highest number of RMP facilities are in Texas with 1457. Texas also has the highest number of accidents, deaths, injuries and evacuated with a total of property damage recorded at $644,367,042.  

All data are represented on the map. Sum of RMP facilities, number of accidents, deaths, injuries, evacuated and total property damage can be obtained in the tooltip.  

Filled map is used to show all the states with RMP facilities. 

# Exercise 4: Bridge

<iframe align = "center" width = "1000" height = "800" src = "https://public.tableau.com/views/Exercise4-Bridge/Dashboard1?:showVizHome=no&:embed=true"></iframe>   

<br>

The sufficiency rating of the Skagit River bridge that collapsed into the river, Interstate 5 bridge was recorded at 57.4 out of 100 on a national database and 47 out of 100 in the state database, a score developed to measure bridge ability to remain in service.  
For a bridge to be eligible for federal rehabilitation funding, it must have a sufficiency rating of 80 or below.  
Interstate 5 bridge was built in 1955.  

The bridge was last inspected in August 2012 with sufficiency rating recorded at 53.5 On average, the bridge was inspected once in every 2 years.  

The bridge has a “fracture-critical” design which means a chain reaction of failures could occur with a small crack.  

It has an average daily traffic of 71000 vehicles.  

Most of the answers can be found through online research.
